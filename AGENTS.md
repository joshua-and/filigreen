# Agent context: Filigreen

This file summarizes key raw assets and processes so agents (and maintainers) can work with the repo without re-discovering context.

## Entity

- **Shore of Filigreen LLC** — investment club organized as an LLC in Pennsylvania. Tax forms are submitted via an accounting firm.

## Raw assets (`raw/`)

The `raw/` directory is gitignored. It holds sensitive and export data used for tax and accounting.

### Capital / accounting template

- **`raw/bank_for_daos_capital_tracking.xlsx`** — Simple template for what to export and give to the accounting firm to submit tax forms for Shore of Filigreen LLC. Use this structure when preparing capital allocations, loan performance, and loan details for the accountant.

### Tax process docs

- **`raw/tax_info_security_process.md`** — Instructions for handling tax information securely (storage, access, sharing).
- **`raw/tax_filing_operating_instructions.md`** — Instructions for tax filing (workflow, deadlines, roles, and how to use the capital-tracking template and transaction data).

### Transaction history (full since founding)

- **`raw/transactions_export_1_0xeDC0F81bbD4776dD3194b19D5e45a5d22D77408E_1771846211502.csv`** — Full transaction history on **Ethereum Mainnet** since the founding of Filigreen.
- **`raw/transactions_export_8453_0xeDC0F81bbD4776dD3194b19D5e45a5d22D77408E_1771846265783.csv`** — Full transaction history on **Base** since the founding of Filigreen.

Use these CSVs together with the tax and security docs when preparing exports for the accounting firm or when building tooling that depends on Filigreen's on-chain history.

### Accounting export (generated)

- **`raw/filigreen_accounting_export.csv`** — Single CSV in standard accounting format for Shore of Filigreen LLC. Generated by `scripts/export_accounting_csv.py`. Contains: (1) capital-tracking template data exported from `raw/bank_for_daos_capital_tracking.xlsx` (Member Allocations, Loan Performance, Loan Details), and (2) full on-chain transaction history from the Ethereum Mainnet and Base transaction export CSVs (Section = "Transactions", with Chain column). Regenerate with: `python3 scripts/export_accounting_csv.py`. Intended for providing to the accounting firm alongside the tax process docs. **Views:** `notebooks/accounting_export_views.ipynb` — Jupyter notebook with tables and charts (member allocations, loan performance, loan details, transactions by chain/asset, monthly volume).
