How long have you been in business or operations?
3 years
Tell us about your business. How do you make money, and what do you spend money on? Who are your customers? What’s your business model? What’s something fun or unique about your business?
// This doesn’t need to be an essay, but try to go into some detail.
Refraction earns revenue mainly through event production, event sponsorship and creative program production deals. Our spend is mostly around talent and artist fees as well as the necessary event production costs (venue rental, equipment rental, staffing, F&B, construction and decor). In 3 years we’ve produced events in over 15 cities across 5 continents.  

We have been able to be sustainable and grow revenue, which we have used to invest in the DAO’s activities globally and the launch of IRL.  Attached is our working document of our Livepaper: IRL - The LivePaper - Draft 6 - Partners and Design Edit - 012125 

Where can we find your financial records and transactions? Feel free to drop a link to a folder below, or to identify a set of contract addresses.
// Filigreen specializes in DAOs and small businesses in Web3. We generally expect loan candidates to maintain transparent finances and operations, e.g. via a known set of wallets or contracts on a public blockchain or on a public platform such as Open Collective.
Refraction Financial Statements
// Request
How much money are you requesting?
// This is just an initial request. Feel free to give a ballpark figure unless you have a specific budget in mind.
75000 USD
When do you need this money?
1-3 months. It can be tranched

If we give you money, what do you intend to do with that money?
We will use it for essential hires for our token launch strategy – head of marketing, partnerships associate and business development associate.  We see these as essential areas of growth as we work towards our launch, and continue to build Refractions event sponsorship and partnership side in parallel paths.
If you have any additional needs, let us know. 
// Feel free to just write some phrases. 
We would be interested in learning more from the group around token design and strategies they have seen work in the past, based on our Livepaper (our whitepaper). Also if there are any folks who have deep networks in terms of market makers
// Review
These are the community members of Filigreen. Who do you think would be most qualified to evaluate your business? Please note any members with whom you have interacted before or have an existing relationship with. (Note, conflicts of interest are not necessarily bad).

Is your business interested in becoming a member of Filigreen?
// [This policy is pending legal review.] If yes, we’ll help. In particular, we’ll take 50% of all interest you pay on your loan and set it up as a “staked investment” in Filigreen. This makes your business a limited member of Filigreen, with all the rights of a common member except that (1) you can’t take the money out unless the common members vote to let you and (2) the governance structure for managing the staked investment is set by the proposer of the loan. This process begins with the first interest payment. However, you get nothing if you don’t pay back your entire loan (principal and interest).
Yes

Optional: please share any feedback on this form or any part of the application process.
The form was clear and concise, which I think is a smart way to do it.

// What’s next: we will convert this document into a prospectus and share it with the members of Filigreen. Members of Filigreen will respond to you directly in this doc, so please make sure you are getting notifications for comments and suggestions.

// The goal of Filigreen is to understand, support, and build small businesses in Web3. We evaluate loan applications on many dimensions beyond likelihood of loan repayment. If your application is not accepted, don’t take it as a signal about the overall viability of your business.
