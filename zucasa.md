## About

### What does your business do? (200 characters or less)

We buy hotel rooms in bulk, at 50% discount to retail prices, at locations with major web3 events 6 months prior to the event. We convert each room to an NFT and add our margin (30% minimum). We then sell both B2B and B2C, allowing for a secondary market.

### How long have you been in business or operations?

Less than 1 year, operational since September 2024.

### Tell us about your business

We know that crypto-natives use conferences and pop-up cities for in-person gatherings, more than just professional networking—they are the emergence of new societies.

Although internet booking platforms exist, none accept crypto or cater to unincorporated communities like DAOs.

ZuCasa books rooms months ahead of major events at 50%+ discounts, converts bookings into NFTs, and sells them B2B and B2C with a minimum 30% margin. Our vision is to become the "Booking.com" for Web3, then expand to digital nomads and other communities.

We seek working capital to:
- Lock loaned funds for 6 months and provide a 10% return.
- Recycle funds across events to scale.
- Eventually establish a continuous credit line.

**Expenses:**
- Legal, operations, salaries, community management, tickets, food, accommodation.

**Our customers:**
- DAOs
- Startups
- Web3 nomads and individuals

**Fun fact:** We bring people together—first dinner at ZuCasa Bangkok was a major highlight.

### Where can we find your financial records and transactions?
