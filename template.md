# Prospectus for Filigreen - Template

## About

### What does your business do? (200 characters or less)

E.g. Rock DAO sells real rocks and dirt to budding network states.

### Who works at your business?

Joshua Tan and John Garry lead Rock DAO. Josh focuses on carving the rocks, while John is responsible for selling them. We’ve been doing it together for three years (10 years if you count our work at the Bezos Rock Corporation), we’re good at it, and we’ve made money every year.

### How long have you been in business or operations?

E.g. 3 years.

### Tell us about your business
<!--This doesn’t need to be an essay, but try to go into some detail.-->

E.g. Rock DAO spends money buying rocks, cleaning them, storing them, and shipping them. We make money by selling those rocks, mostly to network state projects organized as DAOs.

### Where can we find your financial records and transactions?
<!--Filigreen specializes in DAOs and small businesses in Web3. We generally expect loan candidates to maintain transparent finances and operations, e.g. via a known set of wallets or contracts on a public blockchain or on a public platform such as Open Collective.-->

E.g. https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/abcd or eth:0x123.

## Request

### How much money are you requesting?
<!--This is just an initial request. Feel free to give a ballpark figure unless you have a specific budget in mind.-->

E.g. 50,000 USD.

### When do you need this money?

E.g. In six months. Or: as soon as possible.

### If we give you money, what do you intend to do with that money?

E.g. I would use it to hire a new director of business development so that we can hit 1 million USD in revenue by next quarter.

### If you have any additional needs, let us know.
<!--This question is optional. Feel free to just write some phrases.-->

E.g. recruiting developers, growth strategy, governance, legal advice, token design

## Review

### Who do you think would be most qualified to evaluate your business?

E.g. Joshua Tan. I’ve also worked with Griff Green before a couple of times at crypto conferences.

### Contributor or employee who can write a short review

<!--You can name yourself.-->

E.g. Larry Page <larry@google.com>.

## Membership

### Is your business interested in becoming a member of Filigreen?
<!--[This policy is pending legal review.] If yes, we’ll help. In particular, we’ll take 50% of all interest you pay on your loan and set it up as a “staked investment” in Filigreen. This makes your business a limited member of Filigreen, with all the rights of a common member except that (1) you can’t take the money out unless the common members vote to let you and (2) the governance structure for managing the staked investment is set by the proposer of the loan. This process begins with the first interest payment. However, you get nothing if you don’t pay back your entire loan (principal and interest).-->

E.g. Yes.

## Legal

### Legal entity information

E.g. RockDAO is not incorporated anywhere. Josh and John are both based in the USA.

### Legal representative

E.g. Bob Blalaw, Esq. <bob@blalaw.com>

### Feedback

E.g. This form was relatively short. Thanks for that!

<!--
What’s next: we will convert this document into a prospectus and share it with the members of Filigreen. Members of Filigreen will respond to you directly in this doc, so please make sure you are getting notifications for comments and suggestions.

The goal of Filigreen is to understand, support, and build small businesses in Web3. We evaluate loan applications on many dimensions beyond likelihood of loan repayment. If your application is not accepted, don’t take it as a signal about the overall viability of your business.-->
